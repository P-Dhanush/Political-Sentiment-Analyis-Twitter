# Political-Sentiment-Analyis-Twitter
This repository contains code and data for a Twitter sentiment analysis project. The project involves preprocessing and analyzing Twitter data, generating word clouds, and building a machine learning model to classify tweets into three categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive sentiment.
# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to determine sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into three categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive sentiment.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following key sections:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and processing Twitter data, including text normalization, stopword removal, and tokenization.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Generating word clouds to visualize the most common words in each sentiment category.

Model Building: Building a sentiment classification model using Logistic Regression.

Evaluation: Calculating precision, recall, and accuracy for model performance.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the required Python packages installed, such as NumPy, pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, and wordcloud. You can use the following commands to install these packages:

**pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn wordcloud**

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, generate word clouds, and build the sentiment classification model.

View the results of the analysis, including confusion matrices and evaluation metrics.
